            <p><i><h2>Types Of Programming Languages : </h2></i></p>
            <p><big> Programming language can be devide into main types and levels as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li><b><h4>Machine language :</h4></b> it is the lowest level of programming languages , which means dealing with the machine directly using the 
                        binary data system (0:1) , so itis dificult for humans to understand this.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       <b> <h4>High-level language :</h4></b> those language that humans can deal with because they contain composed commands , there are symbols and texts 
                        fimilar to the user when these symbol and vocabulary are written similar to writing the english language .
                    </li>
                    <li><b><h4>Assembly language :</h4></b> which thw highly twisted languages that suppress hte programmes are converted in to DAT mali languges , the most important 
                     of which is humiliation , and the assembly language is very close to the JIFE language .</li></ul> </big></p>
    <p><i><h2>characteristics Of Programming :</h2></i></p>
            <p><big>There are many characteristics that programmong language must provide, among this characteristics are :
            <ul>
                <li><b><h4>Simplicity :</h4></b>programming languages must enjoy simplicity and smoothness that enables users to deal with them in an easy way .</li>
                 <li><b></b><h4>Efficiency:</h4></b> programming languages must be characteristized by the ability to work very efficiently on devices , when the programming 
                languages does not require a lot of storage space on the devices. </li>
                <li><b><h4>Structuring :</h4></b> Programming language must allow their users to write their programs accorging to the concepts of organized 
                programming and familiarity .</li>
                <li><b><h4>Ease of detecting errors:</h4></b> programming languages must contain a method for checking errors that the programmer may encounter 
                when writing an actual program using that language .</li>
                <li><b><h4>Portability:</h4> </b> the programming language must be portable , meaning that the program writtwn in it can be transfered from one 
                device to anthor one .  </li></ul>
