            <p><i><h2>The History Of Programming Languages : </h2></i></p>
            <p><big>The history of the emergence of programming languages goes back to more than 125 years before the emergence of the computer itself,
                when programming languages appeared for the first time in son industerial uses;they were adopted to control the production of textiles 
                by designing holes in the shape of two holes on different types of cards , so that those cards are changed to prouduce different types of
                textiles.
            </big></p>
            <p><big>The real emergence of the first programmong language in the year 1950 AD . </big></p>
            <p><big>Where a team from (IDM) company developed a programming language knowen as (FORTRAN), and then followed in 1953 AD the 
            emergence of the second oldest programming language knowen as (LISP) , and the emergence of various programming languages followed 
            through the twenth century, where some programming languages that are still so far , the cost of (BASIC) programming is used , which was invented
            in 1964. </big></p>
            <p><big>The spread of the internet led of the development of many programming languages , Tim-Berners-Lee developed the HTML in 1990, 
            followed in the following year by the emergence of two of the most important programming languages in the worled is PYTHON , and in 
             1995 was the year of the emergence of JAVA which was presented by programmers in a company from Microsoft (SUN MOCROSYSTEMS)  , and 
             at the present time there are tens of thousandes of diffrent programming language as well as the contionus development of new languages 
             that designers say will contribute in solving any destructiveness present in the life of human.  </big></p>
